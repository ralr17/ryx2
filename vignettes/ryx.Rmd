## Let's go over how to use the functions in ryx

# Let's first show how to use ryx()
```{r}
library(MASS)
object <- ryx(Boston, y="medv")
```

# Now let's get a summary of the correlations between medv and all the other variables
```{r}
summary(object)
```

# Now let's print out all of the correlations between medv and all the other variables

```{r}
print(object)
```

# Now let's plot all of the correlations between medv and all the other variables
```{r}
plot(object)
